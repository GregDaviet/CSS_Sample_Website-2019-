The dating game is a minefield and it’s one that must be entered with trepidation.

There are few things in life that are more uncertain than a first date.

What should you wear? Where should you go? Do you bring flowers on a first date: yes or no?

It’s so hard to know what to expect from a modern day first date as a huge number of people now e-meet on dating websites and social media websites so the chances are they don’t really know one another when they turn up nervously for their romantic encounter.

So do you go in all guns blazing or play it on the cool side?

Keep in mind that the modern day woman scares easily, so the consensus among modern men is, ‘no’.
