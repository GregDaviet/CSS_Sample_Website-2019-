<p>The dating game is a minefield and it’s one that must be entered with trepidation.</p>

<p>There are few things in life that are more uncertain than a first date.</p>

<p>What should you wear? Where should you go? Do you bring flowers on a first date: yes or no?</p>

<p>It’s so hard to know what to expect from a modern day first date as a huge number of people now e-meet on dating websites and social media websites so the chances are they don’t really know one another when they turn up nervously for their romantic encounter.</p>

<p>So do you go in all guns blazing or play it on the cool side?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the modern day woman scares easily, so the consensus among modern men is, ‘no’.</p>
